title: "Multimodal Met Museum Semantic Networks"

## Use case: Extracting semantic concepts from museum objects and visualizing connections

Historically, analyzing visual patterns or latent themes across large-scale physical collections was a manual, slow task reserved for specialists. Traditional computer vision (like computing color histograms or edge detection) and natural language processing (like TF-IDF or keyword matching) often miss the "vibe" or deeper contextual and symbolic connections of art. 

Using a multimodal Vision-Language Model (VLM) like Gemini, we can perform "semantic feature extraction" (essentially a reverse CLIP approach) to describe and tag visual elements into structured natural language concepts, and map these interconnections into an interactive network.

### Workflow overview

1.  Query the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access API to fetch public domain paintings.
2.  Download the images and store metadata locally.
3.  Use the Gemini API with a `.env` file to programmatically analyze each artwork, returning structured JSON tags (dominant colors, visual subjects, emotional mood, latent research themes).
4.  Build an interactive HTML network graph connecting artworks to their shared semantic concepts.
5.  Document your work in a Quarto document and share your project on GitHub.

### Data and Setup

-   **API:** We will use the [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access API](https://metmuseum.github.io/), which requires no API keys and allows searching and retrieving public-domain collections.
-   **Gemini API Key:** You must use a `.env` file to securely load your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
-   **Libraries:**
    -   If using Python: favor `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `openai`, and `pyvis` for interactive network visualization.
    -   If using R: favor `httr2`, `dotenv`, `openai`, and `visNetwork` or `networkD3` for the interactive network.

### Ask

-   **Session 1: API Fetching & Gemini Feature Extraction**
    -   Brainstorm with your agent in `plan` mode to handle the Met API query. Fetch details for 15-20 public-domain paintings from a specific department (e.g., "European Paintings" or "Asian Art").
    -   Ensure your agent writes clean, reproducible code to download images to a local folder (e.g., `images/`) and save basic metadata (title, artist, year, medium) in a CSV file.
    -   Instruct your agent to write a script that securely loads the Gemini API key from `.env`.
    -   Iterate over the images, sending both the image file and its metadata to Gemini. Instruct the model to return a structured JSON response extracting:
        -   **Dominant palette:** 3 distinct visual colors (e.g., "warm gold", "deep indigo").
        -   **Visual concepts:** Primary subjects/objects visible in the work.
        -   **Mood/Vibe:** The overall emotional tone (e.g., "melancholic", "serene", "triumphant").
        -   **Research themes:** Latent themes (e.g., "social status", "nature", "domesticity").
    -   Combine Gemini's output with the original metadata into an enriched dataset (e.g., `enriched_collection.csv`).

-   **Session 2: Mapping the Semantic Web**
    -   Work with your agent to write a visualization script using the enriched dataset.
    -   **Define your network logic & edge weights:** There are two great ways to model this network:
        -   **Option A: Bipartite Graph (Artworks connected to Tags):** Nodes are *both* Artworks and Semantic Tags (colors, vibes, themes). Edges are unweighted, representing a binary match (e.g. Artwork $A$ has tag "melancholic").
        -   **Option B: Projected Graph (Artworks connected to Artworks):** Nodes are *only* Artworks. An edge is drawn directly between Artwork $A$ and Artwork $B$. The **edge weight** is the number of shared semantic tags between them (e.g., if both share "warm gold", "nature", and "serene", the weight is 3). Thicker lines represent stronger visual or thematic links!
    -   Build an interactive HTML network graph where:
        -   **Nodes** represent either the artworks or the extracted concepts depending on your chosen network logic above.
        -   **Edges (lines)** represent connections, optionally adjusting the line thickness (weight) based on the number of shared attributes if using Option B.
        -   **Styling:** Color-code artwork nodes by historical century or artistic movement, and attribute nodes by category.
    -   **Rich Interactivity:** Do not just create basic colored circles for nodes!
        -   For Artwork nodes, set the node shape to be an image and provide the local path to the downloaded thumbnail so the artwork is visible directly on the graph.
        -   Utilize the node's title attribute (which supports HTML) to create a rich hover tooltip. When hovering over an artwork node, the tooltip should display:
            -   An `<img>` tag of the artwork.
            -   The Title and Artist in bold.
            -   The extracted Gemini concepts (Mood, Palette).
            -   An `<a href="...">` link to the original Met Museum object page.
    -   Open the generated HTML and explore the interactive graph. Look for unexpected connections—such as a 17th-century oil painting and a 20th-century piece clustering together based on shared mood or latent research themes.
    -   Include this interactive visualization in your Quarto document, add your findings and analysis, and publish the final site to GitHub Pages.
